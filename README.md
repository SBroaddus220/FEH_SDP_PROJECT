The goal of this game is to drag the box from the beginning of the maze to the end of the maze without touching the walls.

If the user touches the walls inside any of the three levels then the entire game is <em>reset to the beginning</em>.

The following image displays the menu of the game, here the user has the option to: play the game in single or two player mode, see the game's stats, view the instructions on how to play the game, view the credits, and quit the game. When the player either successfully beats the game or dies in one of the levels, they are returned to this menu screen. This lets the player choose to replay the game or select any of the other options.

<h3>GAME MODES:</h3>
This game offers two game modes: a single player mode and a two player mode.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Single player mode:</em> The player will drag their box to the end of three levels. The goal of this game mode is to complete the game and to score the highest. There are time limits that vary for each level and the time that the user completes each level changes how their individual score is calculated at the end.</li>
 	<li><em>Two player mode:</em> Each player will cycle through the levels upon the death or completion of the other player. If any player dies on any of the levels, then they cannot continue playing and the other player is able to see how far they can go. The first player starts the game first at the beginning of the game. The winning player is decided upon which player has the most points. These points are calculated based on how many levels they have beaten and their speed for each level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SCORE:</h3>
Upon the completion of each level in both game modes, the score for the player is calculated by the time in which the player completed the level. Each level has a different multiplier, awarded the player as they successfully navigate more through the game. The scores recorded from each session are recorded in the simulated SD card of the Proteus Simulator.
