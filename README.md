<h2>GOAL:</h2>

The goal of this game is to drag the box from the beginning of the maze to the end of the maze without touching the walls.

If the user touches the walls inside any of the three levels then the entire game is <em>reset to the beginning</em>.

At the main menu, the user has the option to: play the game in single or two player mode, see the game's stats, view the instructions on how to play the game, view the credits, or quit the game. When the player either successfully beats the game or dies in one of the levels, they are returned to this menu screen. This lets the player choose to replay the game or select any of the other options.

<h2>GAME MODES:</h2>
This game offers two game modes: a single player mode and a two player mode.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Single player mode:</em> The player will drag their box to the end of three levels. The goal of this game mode is to complete the game and to score the highest. There are time limits that vary for each level and the time that the user completes each level changes how their individual score is calculated at the end.</li>
 	<li><em>Two player mode:</em> Each player will cycle through the levels upon the death or completion of the other player. If any player dies on any of the levels, then they cannot continue playing and the other player is able to see how far they can go. The first player starts the game first at the beginning of the game. The winning player is decided upon which player has the most points. These points are calculated based on how many levels they have beaten and their speed for each level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GAMEPLAY:</h2>
The game consists of a player block which is dragged to the finish line. To drag, a click just has to be detected within the boundaries of the block and held for the duration of the drag. The finish line is denoted by a small red rectangle at the end of the maze opposite to the player block. Level one of this game is shown below.

The player block is shown as a red square at the beginning of the left side of the maze, and the finish line is denoted by a thin red rectangle t<span style="font-size: 16px;">hat the player block has to touch to continue to the next level.</span>

If the block touches the walls, the game <em>resets,Â </em>forcing the game back to the main menu where more options can be chosen.
<h3>Gravity</h3>
After an initial touch is detected at the beginning of the level, the block experiences gravity. Gravity is a constant accelerations downwards that is active if the block is no longer being dragged. This forces the block to be continuously dragged to the end and creates another obstacle that has to be considered at all times.
<h3>Time Limits</h3>
Within each level, the remaining time is displayed in seconds in the lower right-hand corner. This time varies from level to level and determines the score awarded to the player upon the completion of each level. A faster time results in a larger score for each level. When the time runs out, the player is kicked back to the main menu of the game.

Each level has a score multiplier that is based on when the player completes each level. High levels award a larger amount of points compared to lower levels. The goal is to get the largest score and to beat the game within the allotted amount of time.

<h2>SCORE:</h2>
Upon the completion of each level in both game modes, the score for the player is calculated by the time in which the player completed the level. Each level has a different multiplier, awarded the player as they successfully navigate more through the game. The scores recorded from each session are recorded in the simulated SD card of the Proteus Simulator.
